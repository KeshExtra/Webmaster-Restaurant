                The Founding of Pallet de Dieu<br>
                1922
            </h2>
            <p>
                Palette De Dieu was established in 1922 by a group of French refugees who had fled the devastation of
                World War I. Seeking to provide solace and nourishment to fellow displaced war veterans in New York
                City, the founders initially opened the restaurant as a humble soup kitchen. Their primary mission was
                to offer comfort and sustenance to those recovering from the trauma of war, with an emphasis on
                plant-based, nourishing meals that could help heal both body and spirit.

                As the restaurant began to grow, the founders, deeply impacted by the violence they had experienced,
                embraced non-violence as their core philosophy. This commitment led them to adopt a vegan-based approach
                to their menu, believing that by avoiding animal products, they could not only foster peace within
                themselves but also contribute to a more compassionate world. This shift in philosophy helped them avoid
                the trauma they had experineced in the war.
